It\u2019s the deepest emotional connection that occurs usually just after the baby is born, and I believe its effects continue for years afterward in various ways. From the parents\u2019 point of view, there is the feeling of joy and responsibility. From the baby\u2019s perspective, there is a feeling of security because their basic needs are fulfilled. Humans are like that \u2013 we need to bond with the people who surround us and feel secure and safe.
