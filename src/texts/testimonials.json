In addition, as new parents, We found ourselves looking for games and exercises that we can do with our baby and will help her development. Lilach helped us with both - we began with some exercises that helped our baby to look at both directions, then she taught us different activities that we use today during play time. She also helped us to understand what we can expect in each stage of her development. We highly recommend Lilach for parents that are looking for toolbox and ideas that can help their babyâ€™s development."

And to top it all, I got to build my village with the other mothers who attended her classes."
